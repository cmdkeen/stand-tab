title: Blog working - on to _real_ work

Finally, after much more mucking around I've worked out how to get the site looking half decent. That and sorted out my various git branches to contain what I want them to.

That took much longer than I though, but then it is the first time I've done something like this so my expectations were probably a bit off.

Now off to tackle work:

* Fixing the mistakes highlighted in the demo
* Playing around with GCC constraints
* Messaging other debaters to try and get more examples written up in Essence'
