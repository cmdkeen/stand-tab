Gave a demo of what I had working so far to my project supervisor and second marker today. After much hard work over the past few days to make up for a woeful lack of work recently I thought I had it all set-up perfectly for what I wanted to demonstrate.

I even managed to get my Worlds Schools Essence' code to run in 17 seconds for 16 teams, given I'd had 38 teams running for 10 hours with no result I at least had something to show on that front too.

Of course the demon bugs of project demos came to play, Dilbert was correct as always. One of my tests stopped working, and the other is producing incorrect results. Typical. However I'm pretty sure I know what went wrong so can get on with fixing them to move onwards.

There was some good news at least, some really helpful suggestions came out of the meeting about how to improve what I was doing:

* Use 'soft constraints' and an objective function so that slower models will let the user decide whether to wait for a potentially better solution, or end the run and use the current best solution.
* GCC - or the Generalized Cardinality Constraint has apparently just been added to [minion](http://minion.sourceforge.net/) and [tailor](http://www.cs.st-and.ac.uk/~andrea/tailor/) - basically it looks a bit like atmost but allows for global propagation. Which should be much faster.
