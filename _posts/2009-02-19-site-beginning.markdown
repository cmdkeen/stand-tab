Having become fed up of using SVN synching from within Eclipse for my university project I stumbled upon [GitHub](http://github.com) for hosting the code.

Looking around at other projects I discovered the other ace feature, allegedly _easy_ blog creation for you project. Whilst the documentation wasn't the most helpful in places it seems to be going well (at least if you can read this it is!)

As well as starting to use GitHub I've been on a bit of a signing-up-to-services binge, I'm using [FogBugz](http://www.fogbugz.com) to keep track of what I need to be doing, Eclipse's //TODO not quite hacking it for anything more major than little code alterations.
